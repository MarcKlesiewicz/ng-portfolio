<p>
  As part of my education as a computer science AP graduate, I collaborated with the app agency
  <a href="https://littlegiants.dk/">LittleGiants</a> to develop a product for one of their clients – Monto.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Monto is a danish rental platform that allows private individuals and businesses to rent out items within their local
  area. The platform enables owners to earn money on everything from tools, clothing, car-trailers, speakers and board
  games. It can best be described as a kind of &quot;Airbnb&quot; for everyday items.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Notable features include:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rental item management: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), including image upload for each item.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complex calendar management: Scheduling rental periods and handling bulk discounts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Filtering of rental items: Search based on keywords, main and subcategories, as well as geographic location with
      boundaries.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Rental agreement management: A structured process for creating and maintaining rental agreements.</p></li>
  <li><p>1-to-1 live chat: A direct communication channel between the renter and the owner.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Review and rating system: Users can leave reviews and ratings to help others choose reliable owners and products.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admin: Management of main and subcategories, platform statistics/key metrics, reporting.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  My role in the project was to implement the frontend of the application using Flutter. Although it was my first
  experience with cross-platform development, I had the opportunity to develop both large and small parts of Monto.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The project was an invaluable learning experience where I gained skills in component-based programming, software
  architecture, best practices for mobile UI design concepts, and real project management.
</p>
<p>
  Working with Flutter inspired me to continue exploring and specializing in app development, and about a year later, I
  had the opportunity to implement the web version of Monto – where, for a period, I took on the role of lead developer.
