  In the realm of package management, Selvhent stands out as a revolutionary digital warehouse management system
  tailored specifically for parcel shops. Designed to be simple to operate and install, Selvhent optimizes package
  storage, scales seamlessly to match the size of any shop, and significantly reduces the time spent on package
  handling—saving up to two-thirds of the time for both employees and customers.

<p>The system is composed of two primary components:</p>

    <p>
      Customer Unit – A sleek, durable kiosk with an intuitive touchscreen interface that guides customers effortlessly
      through the process of providing necessary package information.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      Warehouse Unit – A tablet-based system that tracks package locations with pinpoint accuracy, identifies unclaimed
      packages that need to be returned, and revolutionizes how parcel shops organize and retrieve packages.
    </p>
