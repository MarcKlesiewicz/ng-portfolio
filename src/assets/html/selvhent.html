  In the realm of package management, _Sevhent_ stands out as a revolutionary digital warehouse management system
  tailored specifically for parcel shops. Designed to be simple to operate and install, _Sevhent_ optimizes package
  storage, scales seamlessly to match the size of any shop, and significantly reduces the time spent on package
  handling—saving up to two-thirds of the time for both employees and customers.

<p>The system is composed of two primary components:</p>

  <li>
    <p>
      Customer Unit – A sleek, durable kiosk with an intuitive touchscreen interface that guides customers effortlessly
      through the process of providing necessary package information.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Warehouse Unit – A tablet-based system that tracks package locations with pinpoint accuracy, identifies unclaimed
      packages that need to be returned, and revolutionizes how parcel shops organize and retrieve packages.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

  My role in this project was to implement the web-based admin application using Flutter and to handle pickup requests
