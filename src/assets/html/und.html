  One of the first projects that landed on my desk as a newly hired frontend developer was Up N' Down. The client had a
  clear vision of developing a platform for golfers interested in improving their game and finding inspiration for new
  exercises and general training.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Up N' Down uses entered golf-related data to tailor and recommend exercises and tips that match the user's needs. You
  can also choose to browse among more than 50 different exercises. Each exercise is accompanied by a video
  demonstrating the exercise. Additionally, you'll find a descriptive step-by-step guide explaining how to approach the
  exercise and which skills you can improve.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Notable features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Onboarding wizard: User registration with golf-related input</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Custom video player: Playback of specific exercises, timestamps, fullscreen mode, skip/fast forward</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community: Like and save exercises + challenges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Admin: Management of main and subcategories, platform statistics/key metrics, reporting and upload new exercises
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  In this project, the client provided a design and a fully developed backend that exposed several GraphQL endpoints.
  The frontend implementation was therefore carried out very linearly and was 95% complete after the first month.
