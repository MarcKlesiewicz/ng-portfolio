  Somewhere in Odense, Denmark, a determined entrepreneur named Jakob is working hard to make life safer for people
  living with epilepsy. After completing my degree in computer science and starting full-time as a frontend developer, I
  had the chance to assist Jakob on his journey to bring MyEpi to life.

<h4>Mobile application</h4>
<p>
  As a patient, you can track your epileptic seizures and gain more insight into the condition through community
  updates. At the same time, the app allows family members to be notified with the time and location when a seizure is
  registered by the patient's Apple Watch.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Watch application</h4>
<p>
  The genius of MyEpi lies in the integration with the Apple Watch application, which leverages the watch's built-in
  technology to detect epilepsy-characteristic seizures and send alerts to family members.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Notable features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Seizure detection: Detection of epileptic seizures via Apple Watch</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family notifications: Alerting family members through notifications or SMS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seizure history management: Managing automatically and manually entered seizure history</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Documentation generation: Generating periodic documentation of past seizures in PDF format</p></li>
</ul>

  I took over the project after it had been in its MVP phase, so there was already an existing codebase to work with. My
  task was to fine-tune most of the user interface with a new design and implement the periodic PDF generation flow.
</p>

<p>
  The backend was built using Google Firebase but was planned to be replaced later. As a result, my work on MyEpi also
  involved cleaning up redundant code and restructuring the app's state management using Riverpod.
